# DSA-in-Cpp

ðŸŒ¸ This repository contains the problems that I practice on a regular basis. It is basically notes/solutions for revision during placement preparation for myself. Aim of this repository is to improve my skill in cpp programming and to master data structure and algorithm. It is a personal journey and I will keep updating as I solve moreproblem and learn new concepts. 

ðŸ§© topics covered includes:

1. Iterative statements
2. Functions
3. Strings
4. OOPs
5. Patterns
6. Arrays
7. Linked list
8. Stacks & Queues
9. Trees & Graphs
10. Recursion & Backtracking
11. Sorting
12. Searching

ðŸŒ± these are the topics that I have decided to cover first and I will likely learn and add more as I progress.
Feel free to explore the code, clone this repo, and use the solutions as reference for learning.
