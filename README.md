# DSA-in-Cpp

ðŸŒ¸ This repository contains the problems that I practice on a regular basis. It is basically notes/solutions for revision during placement preparation for myself. Aim of this repository is to improve my skill in cpp programming and to master data structure and algorithm. It is a personal journey and I will keep updating as I solve moreproblem and learn new concepts. 

ðŸ§© This repository contains:

1. Notes for prep work and revision 
2. Iterative statements
3. Functions
4. Strings
5. OOPs
6. Patterns
7. Arrays
8. Linked list
9. Stacks & Queues
10. Trees & Graphs
11. Recursion & Backtracking
12. Sorting
13. Searching

ðŸŒ± these are the topics that I have decided to cover first and I will likely learn and add more as I progress.
Feel free to explore the code, clone this repo, and use the solutions as reference for learning.
